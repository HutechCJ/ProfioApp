# Entity Description

## Identity Schema

<p align="justify">
ASP.NET Core Identity is an API, which provides a framework for implementing authentication and authorization in .NET Core applications. It is an open-source replacement for the previous ASP.NET Membership system. ASP.NET Core Identity allows you to add login features to your application and makes it easy to customize data about the logged-in user.
</p>

<p align="justify">
ASP.NET Core Identity uses a SQL Server database to store user names, passwords, and profile data. The schema for the database is automatically created when you create the project. The schema is based on the ASP.NET Core Identity Entity Framework Core Code First default schema. The schema is designed to support the default ASP.NET Core Identity UI, which you can scaffold into your project.
