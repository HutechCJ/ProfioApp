# Scenario

<p align="justify">

In our endeavor to streamline logistics operations and enhance overall efficiency, we propose a comprehensive tracking and management system. This system is designed to provide real-time visibility, optimize route planning, and facilitate incident resolution within the supply chain. The solution can be broken down into several key components:

In our continuous efforts to streamline logistics operations, we propose a comprehensive tracking and management system that aims to significantly enhance efficiency, provide real-time visibility, optimize route planning, and facilitate incident resolution within the supply chain. This solution comprises several key components:

</p>

## 1. Real-time Vehicle Tracking based on Zip Codes

<p align="justify">

**Objective**: To monitor and update the status of transportation vehicles based on zip codes.

**Description**: Each transportation vehicle is equipped with a sophisticated zip code-based location tracking system. This system maintains an exhaustive database of all hubs within Vietnam, including their respective zip codes and proximity to the nearest hub. In the event of a hub reporting an incident or encountering a breakdown, the system swiftly identifies the current zip code of the transporting vehicle. Leveraging the hub information, the system determines the nearest hub based on the current zip code and meticulously calculates the shortest route from the vehicle's current location to the nearest hub. Importantly, it keeps a meticulous record of the journey history, capturing each hub visited along the way, thereby providing complete transparency.

</p>

## 2. Efficient Route Planning and Mode Transition

<p align="justify">

**Objective**: To optimize routes and determine the most suitable mode of transportation.

**Description**: In scenarios where the system cannot locate the nearest hub or the chosen route becomes impassable, it promptly alerts the management team to explore alternative solutions. Additionally, the system employs intelligent algorithms to identify the most suitable mode of transportation for each order. For instance, it might recommend transitioning from a truck to a motorcycle for intra-city deliveries or vice versa for inter-provincial shipments. This ensures not only cost-effective deliveries but also timely ones while accommodating specific delivery requirements.

</p>

## 3. Real-time Estimated Delivery Times

<p align="justify">

**Objective**: To provide customers and stakeholders with accurate estimated delivery times.

**Description**: The system continuously updates and communicates estimated delivery times to customers, suppliers, and other relevant stakeholders. These estimations rely on real-time tracking, dynamic route optimization, and historical performance data. This practice ensures that customers have precise and up-to-the-minute expectations regarding the arrival of their orders, thereby enhancing overall satisfaction.

</p>

## 4. Assigned Personnel Information

<p align="justify">

**Objective**: To associate each vehicle with responsible personnel.

**Description**: Every vehicle in the fleet is meticulously linked to a designated staff member who assumes responsibility for its operations. This association promotes accountability and facilitates efficient communication and problem-solving during transit. Personnel information includes contact details, roles, responsibilities, and performance records.

</p>

## 5. Delivery Progress Monitoring

<p align="justify">

**Objective**: To track the progress of each delivery with granularity.

**Description**: For every order, the system maintains a comprehensive record of the delivery progress. This includes the percentage of the journey completed, the estimated time to completion, any exceptional circumstances encountered, and specific notes or comments. This level of detail supports proactive monitoring, enables timely intervention in case of issues, and facilitates effective customer communication.

</p>

## 6. Incident Management

<p align="justify">

**Objective**: To record and manage incidents promptly.

**Description**: The system has a robust incident management module that records and categorizes incidents occurring at hubs or involving vehicles. It captures details such as the time of occurrence, the nature of the incident, involved parties, and comprehensive descriptions. This recorded data serves as a crucial resource for post-incident analysis, resolution, and process improvement.

By implementing this advanced logistics tracking and management system, our ultimate goal is to bring about a significant transformation in the efficiency and transparency of our supply chain operations. We aim to provide our customers with timely and accurate delivery updates, proactively address issues, and optimize route planning throughout our entire logistics network in Vietnam.
